This app is designed for community-driven pet-sitting. 
Users create their own accounts and schedule pet-sitting appointments that will be fulfilled by other users.

Note: This is a "minimum viable product" prototype for a larger application. This application was built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. 

**Motivation**
* * *
Build an easy-to-use app that demonstrates:

* Create and manage user accounts and profiles
* Connect with other users for their needs

**Internal Motivation**
* * *

I intentionally developed without an advanced framework in order to strengthen my core full-stack development capabilities. In particular, I focused on the following skills:

* Test-driven development (TDD)
* Component-based web app design
* Server-side APIs providing full CRUD capabilities
* Using promises to manage complex asynchronous function chains

I also built this without a framework to gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of the technologies and techniques involved.
